# critical_periods

Code for comment on [Hartshorne, Tenenbaum, &amp; Pinker (2018), Cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718300994?via%3Dihub)

This repository contains an Rmd of some explorations of HTP's 2018 paper on critical periods, including the reproducibility code for a figure in my TiCS spotlight paper.

Note that it depends on data from the HTP paper [OSF repository](https://osf.io/pyb8s/) and also on running a fairly time-consuming MIRT model (1-2 hours of runtime, cached files are too big for github).
